# Project Reflection
## Brief Explanation of the Work
### What code were you given?
For this project, I was provided with the following code:

TreasureMaze.py: This file defines the maze environment and the actions the agent can take.

GameExperience.py: This file manages the experience replay mechanism, which is crucial for training the neural network.

Jupyter Notebook Skeleton: A basic structure for implementing the Q-learning process, including some helper functions for visualization and initial setup.

### What code did you create yourself?
I created the following code:

Q-Training Algorithm: Implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm, including the training loop that balances exploration and exploitation.

Neural Network Model: Designed the neural network architecture to approximate Q-values for state-action pairs.

Training and Evaluation Functions: Developed functions to train the model, store experiences, and evaluate performance through visualization of win rates and losses over epochs.

Visualizations: Added code to plot the win rate and loss over time to assess the training process and determine the optimal number of epochs.

# Connecting Learning to Computer Science

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design algorithms, develop software, and apply computational theories to solve complex problems. Their work is essential for advancing technology, improving efficiencies across various industries, and creating innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. This field is foundational to numerous modern advancements, from healthcare improvements through data analysis to the creation of intelligent systems that enhance daily life.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically by following these steps:

Define the Problem: Clearly understand the problem, its constraints, and requirements.
Research and Plan: Investigate existing solutions, gather relevant information, and outline a detailed plan of action.
Implement and Test: Develop the solution iteratively, ensuring to test each component thoroughly.
Analyze and Improve: Evaluate the performance of the solution, identify areas for improvement, and refine the approach as necessary.
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities include:

Ensuring Reliability: Developing software that is robust, reliable, and performs as intended.

Protecting Privacy: Safeguarding user data and ensuring confidentiality.

Promoting Usability: Creating user-friendly and accessible solutions.

Maintaining Transparency: Being clear about the capabilities and limitations of the technology.

Avoiding Bias: Ensuring that algorithms and systems do not perpetuate or introduce biases.

Benefiting Society: Striving to create technology that has a positive impact on society and contributes to the greater good.
